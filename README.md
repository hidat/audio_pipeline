### File Walker
Walks a directory structure of audio files and does the following:
 * Pulls out the MusicBrainz Release ID, Track Number, and Disc Number from the file metadata
 * Querys MusicBrainz based on the Release ID, Track Number, and Disc Number, and return the metadata for the Track and Release
 * Querys MusicBrainz based on the Artist ID of all artist's in the album's Artist Credit, and return the metadata for each Artist
 * Writes this information out to the destination directory:
   * File are written to a directory structure of the form:  
     *found*: Backup copy of all succesfully processed audio files  
     *not_found*: Copy of all tracks that filewalker did not process successfully  
     *artist_meta*: Serialized artist metadata files  
     *release_meta*: Serialized release metadata files  
     *track_meta*: Serialized track metadata files  
     *track*: All successfully processed audio files, renamed to match the track ItemCode  
     *session_logs*: Tab separated text files of the form:  
      `<Item Type>   <ItemCode>  <Item Name>`  
       Current log files:  
        * *filewalker_log*: all releases, tracks, artists, and labels
        * *label_log*: all labels
        * *release_log*: all releases
   * Serialized metadata files are named according to their ItemCode. Release filenames are given prefix 'r'; artist filenames are given prefix 'a'.
   * Currently files can only be written as Dalet-compatible XML

#####To Run

1. Navigate to the top-level audio_pipeline directory

IMPORTANT: Audio files must have release MBID, as well as track number and disc number associated with that MBID, for FileWalker to succeed. 

   
### TomatoBanana
A program to assist in the review and entry of metadata of ripped audio discs
 * Pulls relevent metadata from audio files
 * Displays release metadata onscreen in an easily human-readable format for review
 * Releases are displayed in the same order that they were ripped, for easy processing when returning discs to cases
 * Allows the easy entry of obscenity rating values for individual tracks
 * An interface for complete metadata entry is easily accessed from a release in TB
  
#####To Run
1. Navigate to the top-level audio_pipeline directory
2. Run `TomatoBanana.py`
